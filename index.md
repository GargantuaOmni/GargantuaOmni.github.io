# Biography

I am a third year undergraduate student in School Of Mathimatical Science at Peking University, majoring Information and Computing Science advised by Prof.Bin Dong. 
My main interest is in Computer Graphics, Image Processing, maybe with Machine Learning method.

# My view of Computer Graphics
Although I have yet deeply dug into this field, I will make some naive comments and opinion on Computer Graphics:
Items with a * represent my personal opinion.

1. There is no doubt that Computer Graphics will merge more and more skills from machine learning or so-called Artificial Intelligence, which could solve many blurred problems intractable for traditional method. The automatic creation or re-build of 3D model and its animation is especially important becuase it will allow us effectively tranform entities from our world into data world or create our own virtual data world, which could significantly improve human's creativity.
2. Computer Graphics will expand its territory since problems in Computer Vision and Image Processing will face large amount of problems or structure in 3D space. Because our world has 3 dimensions, Computer Graphics will play an increasingly important role in those fields which used to be considered in 2D space.
3. *Computer Graphics will become both important in culture (or art, entertainment, mental therapy, etc) realm, _i.e._ virtual world, and in production (or science research, data visualozation, etc), _i.e._ real world. In this case, Computer Graphics may take part into different approach or focus and develop towards different directions. But still, we need to be aware of the fact that we have stepped into a vision society, where sometimes talking "reality" no longer make sense. Therefore, the boundary between these two realm will also fade and lots of merging realms may arise.
4. *To pursue reality and effectiveness is a kernel of Computer Graphics in some way. But the model of Computer Graphics and its defination on reality is limited. In other world, it always focus on _Cartesian perspectivalism_(term from _Scopic Regimes of Modernity_, Martin Jay, 1988). This pursuit on reality and effectiveness maybe not sufficient to the various request from fields like art, culture, design and entertainment. Actually numerous results and products on Siggraph have never come into practice. Perhaps we need to change our mode of thought a bit.
5. *As researchers or users of Computer Graphics, we need to think about how our technologies will influence our future. Criticism and reflection from natural science, socialogy and art history are necessary. We ought to participate in those critiques from the technology itself in the identities of developers. This is also a field that I try to keep one of my eyes on.
